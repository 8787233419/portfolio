# portfolio

I have tried my best for the portfolio site and made using HTML CSS and bootstrap as i had negligible knowledge about all three so i made it with help of some yt videos and some research about various tags etc.
for the brownie point i used php but the mailto function i used in it , i guess it might not be working on non hosted sites.php because searching on internet i thought that i could be a good choice to go with it
